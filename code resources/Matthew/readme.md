# Programming Fundamentals with Music

## Summary
Getting materials together and dealing with the first few basic of concepts of programmming through music.

## Prerequisite Knowledge
No pre-requisite knowledge is required. If you intend on teaching this resource to other students it is recommended to familiarise yourself well by following along. The resources here are presented in Python, but the intention is that they are language agnostic. For some langauges, these resources may be a huge over complication, in which case take them at their spirit and not at their word.

For other languages, it these resources may be an over simplification. As such, some examples of wav file writing have been provided in (currently) C++, Rust as well as Python and ca nhopefully be used as a blueprint for implementations in other language.
