# Creating a piano piece with python notebooks

## Summary
Learn to create simple MIDI piano music through a Python notebook format.

## Prerequisite Knowledge
A very basic understanding of Python, e.g. using variables, print()

## Programming concepts and methods

Introduces:
 - lists
 - loops
 - nested loops
 - conditional statements
 - calling a function, specifying arguments

## How this resource could be used
 - As a way to motivate self-learning and exploration in Python, following a few introductory classes (e.g. session #3 in a course)
 - As a way to explore a notebook-style environment
 - As an exercise sheet for students to self-learn from

## How could this be taken further
 - Students could download their MIDI to be used in music making in a digital audio workstation, allowing examples to go beyond simple MIDI sounds.
 - Students could look at converting their MIDI to actual musical scores, e.g. with [python-ly](https://python-ly.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). This might be particularly fun if you have access to a piano and a good sight reader.
 - Students could start to write their own functions that encapsulate their approach to generating units of musical material

## Technical Resources or Requirements
 - Python notebooks
 - [music21 library](https://pypi.org/project/music21/)
