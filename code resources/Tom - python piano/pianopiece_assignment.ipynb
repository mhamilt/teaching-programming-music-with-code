Your main guide might be: *do I like this?* If not, then how can you change it so you like it more?\n","\n","### Coding considerations\n","- how can you use **lists** to your advantage?\n","    - E.g. lists of notes, timings, velocities, patterns, scales, or perhaps in lots of other ways\n","    - See section 2 for some ideas\n","- how might you use **functions** for structure?\n","  - see sections 3.1 and 3.2 for more on this\n","\n","\n"," ### Practical considerations\n","  - Run the section before to import libraries. This will give you access to the `addNote()` and `addChord()` functions.\n","  - Remember to include `s.clear()` at the start of your code...\n","  - and `s.show('midi') at the end to create the Midi file.\n","\n","\n"," ### Potential inspiration\n","  -
