    "# How to write WAVE Files in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "This sections will cover how to deal with [WAVE format files](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/courses/422-winter-2014/projects/WaveFormat) in python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modules exist already to do a lot of this work, but the purpose here is to demonstrate the principles of creating a wav file from scratch, regardless of the programming langauage used. \n",
    "\n",
    "This resource is presented as a guide for an instructor to create a light-weight utility for students which can be deployed easily which is useful when internet connections break or administrative privileges don't allow for easy installation of additional software.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also a resource for the curious student who would like to know a little more about how audio is packaged up for playback in its simplest form.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following is written in python using just standard libraries. Alongside this article are some examples in other programming languages. Python also comes with the [`wave` module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/wave.html) and an example of using it is gicven in the section [Using the `wave` Module](#Using-the-wave-Module). This is helpful if you're focus is simply on achieving a quick method for audio playback. Much of the same philosophy from the rest of this article is applicable, some components may be a little more opaque when designing a library.\n",

    "## Benefits to Making Your Own Library\n",
    "\n",
    "- agile: you can change it when you need to\n",
    "- reusable: it should be something simple enough you can pass it on to students to modify as they please.\n",
    "- flexible: it should be something you can drop into a project for when administrative priveleges, internet connections and a myriad of other IT disasters conspire against you to derail a lesson plan.\n",
    "- personal: it's _your_ library and you can customuse it as you please. As an instructor you may want to adapt it for creating coding challenges, as a sound designer or musician you might want to add functionality specific to your needs.\n",

    "\n",
    "A couple of notes on terminology before going forward.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pulse Code Modulation (PCM): The format of digital audio typically found in a WAVE file.\n",
    "- Byte Depth vs. Bit Depth: Refer to fundamentally the same thing. Digital PCM audio resolution is generally talked of in bit depth (or bits per sample). Byte depth is simply Bit Depth ÷ 8, or bit depth in units of bytes.\n",
    "- WAVE format vs. wav vs. `.wav`: all refer to a file in the WAVE format and are interchangeably\n",
    "- samples vs. frames: In PCM audio a _sample_ is a single digital amplitude value for a single channel. A _frame_ is a collection of samples for all channels in a single moment in time. This means for monophonic audio 'sample' and 'frame' are _technically_ the same thing, but this resource will attempt to make the distinction clear in situations where increasing the number of channels may cause confusion.\n",
    "- Endian: The order of bytes in a multi-byte number. You could describe the number `234` as starting from the 'big end' with \"2 hundreds, 3 tens, 4 units\"  or the 'little end' as \"4 units, 3 tens, 2 hundreds\". The same applies for data with multiple bytes. What this comes down to is when you have to write a value one byte at a time, what order do you do it in. Don't worry, it will be referred to explicitly when the time comes.\n",

See if the students can also find wav files with other text like `bext` which would indicate a [broadcast extension audio file](https://tech.ebu.ch/docs/tech/tech3285.pdf)\n",
