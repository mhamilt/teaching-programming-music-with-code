    "\n",
    "This is a notebook to introduce or consolidate the concept of functions and modularity to beginner programming students. The later sections can be cut as needed, depending on how much you want students to cover.\n",
    "\n",
    "This resource is probably best suited to students with a bit of a quantitative background, as it refers to some (fairly simple) mathematical notions to contextualise the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key prerequisite is a basic knowledge of Python: variables, lists, and loops (and optionally, plotting). Note that if students are familiar with Numpy arrays, this resource can be adapted to replace loops with vectorised operations on Numpy arrays instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "The technical requirements are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python 3.\n",
    "- `jupyter-notebook` or `jupyter-lab` to run this notebook.\n",
    "- `ipywidgets`, for the audio playback widgets.\n",
    "- `wav_library.py`, provided with this resource as a utility. Note that the construction of this module constitutes one of the other learning resources provided with this book chapter, and could be a good follow-up to the activity presented here.\n",
    "- Two copyright-free audio WAVE files. [Freesound](https://freesound.org/) is a great resource to find these. `piano.wav` and `guitar.wav` are provided as examples.\n",
    "- Optionally, `matplotlib` for plotting waveforms. The plotting sections can be useful to provide another way to visualise the effect of the student's functions, but they can be removed if you have not covered this in your course.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "After going through this notebook, students will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand the concept and advantages of modularity in programming.\n",
    "- Define and use basic functions in Python to structure their code, and understand the difference between _defining_ and _calling_ a function.\n",
    "- Define and use functions with multiple input arguments and return values.\n",
    "- Recognise when it's useful to provide default values for input arguments.\n",
    "- Write functions to fade-in, fade-out, and cross-fade audio files."

    "## What are functions, and why are they useful?\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, you might have used some of the built-in Python functions (e.g. `print()`, `sorted()`), and functions like `math.sin()` or `math.sqrt()` which come with the `math` module. In fact, these functions are _short-hands_ or _interfaces_ for bigger pieces of code which are hidden away. The key idea is _modularity_: you can re-use that code easily any time you need to, and you can reproduce the same set of computations with different input values, without having to re-write all the code every single time.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you _call_ a function, e.g. `math.sqrt(25)`, Python finds the corresponding code in the `math` module for the `sqrt()` function, and executes it, in this case to calculate the square root of `25` and give you the result, `5`. One nice feature is that you can plug in a different number, and it will execute the same code to give you the result for that number as well; thankfully you don't have to go dig into that hidden code and change the number every time you want to calculate a different square root.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, as you start writing longer and more complex programs, this is going to be a very useful idea. In this notebook, you will learn to create **your own custom functions** to structure your programs, and avoid having to copy blocks of code again and again if you want to re-use the same computations in multiple different situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "> _Note: If you know about functions in mathematics, this is actually a very similar concept. A function is an object that takes some input value(s), and transforms the input in a specific, repeatable way to give the corresponding output._"
