# Welcome

Welcolme to the Overleaf project for this book chapter. 

This chapter is tied to GitHub repository https://github.com/mhamilt/teaching-programming-music-with-code

Authors: Please get in touch with your github usernames if you have them and I can add you to the repostory.

For the initial 'pitch', please edit `pitch.tex`.

The central chapter text lives in `chapter.tex`, this in aid of taking out latex setup out of the eyeline.

Please add any pertinent references to the `main.bib` file.

Any questions about Overlead / LaTeX please get in touch with Matthew to organise a call.
